            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Who doesn't love a nice, fluffy baked potato smothered in delicious toppings? But in this busy world, baked potatoes are a time consumption that many can't afford. I know, you can put them on to bake without watching, but what if you are in a hurry?</p>

            <p>I didn't invent this, but I did name them. One day while I was getting ready to leave for work, I wanted to add a little something to meal that my wife had packed for me. I thought about takig a baked potatoe, but I didn't have an hour or more to devote to baking one. That's when I decided, why not try microwaving one?</p>

            <p>I had done mircowaved baked potatoes when I was a kid, but it had been a while. Operating off my memory, I decided to give it a go. Boy was I pleased with the results! Hence the fake baked potatoes are a great in-a-hurry add on to any meal.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>Potatoes</li>
                    <ul><li>I used smaller russet potatoes, but you can use whatever potato you desire.</li></ul>

                <li>Any toppings you like</li>
                    <ul><li>Butter, sour cream, sheese, salt, pepper, chives, etc. Really just whatever you like.</li></ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Thoroughly scrub the potatoes under running water. Make sure they are very clean. Getting some dirt or sand in your mouth is a good way to ruin a good bite.</li>

                <li>Once the potatoes are clean, dry them off.</li>

                <li>Now grab a kitchen towel or oven mitt to hold a potato. With your other hand use a knife or fork to poke several holes in the potato. Just make sure not to stab your hand.</li>

                <li>Using a microwave safe plate, arrange them in a single layer with room between them. Place them in the microwave for 5 minutes on high.</li>

                <li>Once the timer goes off, check the potatoes with a fork or knife. If it goes in easily they are done. Otherwise you can keep microwaving in increments of 2 minutes and checking the potaotes in between.</li>

                <li>Once cooked, top them with your deisred topping and enjoy. Since I was taking mine as my supper to work, I just threw on some butter and warmed them up that evening at work. They were delicious and fluffy!</li>

                <li>Any leftovers can be stored in a Ziploc bag in the fridge for up to a week.</li>
            </ol>
