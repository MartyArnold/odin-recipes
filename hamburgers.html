            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Who doesn't love a good hamburger? The fluffy buns, the juicy meat, and whatever toppings your heart desires - sounds wonderful! This American staple is a delicious meal that is easy on the budget as well as your time.</p>

            <p>Traditionally hamburgers are made with beef, but don't let that restrict you. I have had some delicious pork burgers, and even had some pork/beef mixed burgers. But you can enjoy a turkey burger or a chicken burger too! Just make sure that you cook the burgers to the accurate temperature for the meat you are using. Beef can still be a little pink, but I recommend all others are cooked well done.</p>

            <p>Toppings for a burger can be whatever your heart desires. Some enjoy a plain burger. Others like them traditionally decked out with ketchup, mustard, mayo, pickles, onion, and lettuce. I have heard of some adventurous folks even putting a fried egg or peanut butter on their burgers!</p>

            <p>The recipe below is one that I use regulary to make burgers at home. This recipe works great when either grilling or pan frying. I find that the Worcestershire sauce gives it a great flavor without needing to add extra salt and the pepper puts a nice kick in the burger. I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.</p>

            <p>Also I don't usually measure out the ingredients, I just eyeball it. Feel free to add more or less to your taste.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 lb ground beef - 73/27 does great because you need the fat for flavor and so the burger will stick together</li>

                    <li>2 tbsp black pepper</li>

                    <li>1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>

                    <li>Hamburger buns</li>

                    <li>Desired toppings</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>

                    <li>Start by placing the ground beef (or whatever ground meat you chose) into a large mixing bowl. Then add the pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Mix the ingredients thoroughly using clean hands or a large wooden spoon.</li>

                    <li>Next divide the ground beef into 4 even sized balls. This will give you roughly quarter pound sized patties. (You don't have to be exact in this.) Then flatten them out into a patty shape of roughly 1/2 inch thickness.</li>

                    <li>This step is optional, but if the meat is feeling very sticky and wanting to fall apart, place them on some parchment paper on a baking sheet. Put the baking sheet into the freezer for about 15 minutes to firm them up.</li>

                    <li>Place a large skillet on the stovetop on medium high heat. Fit as many burgers as you can without crowding. Cook them to the desired pinkness. If you have a meat thermometer, check them off the heat to make sure they are reading an internal temp of at least 160 degree F.</li>

                    <li>Once cooked, let the meat rest while you assemble the toppings on your buns. Then enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
