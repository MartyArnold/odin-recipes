            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Lasagna is a tasty meal hailing straight from Italy! It's named after the type of noodle that you use when cooking it. Fun fact: the singular for the noodle is lasanga - I pronounce both the same. It's a filing dish made of alternating layers of lasanga noodles, with a hearty flavored tomato sauce, meat, cheese, and even vegetables!</p>

            <p>I have been cooking this dish for years, ever since I picked it out of a kids cook book. It's a simple dish that doesn't require a lot of skill, but always delivers on the flavor.</p>

            <p>The best tip that I can give you when making this dish is don't rush. It will take about an hour to cook, but you don't want to be hasty with the prep work. Trust me, it's well worth the wait!</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb hamburger meat</li>
                <li>1 medium onion - diced</li>
                <li>1 box uncooked lasanga noodles</li>
                <li>2 jars pasta sauce - any flavor you like</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 15oz tub ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>3 cups shredded mozarella cheese</li>
                <li>A 9 X 13 baking pan</li>
                <li>A mediom skillet</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <p><li>Brown the hamburger meat over medium high heat in a meduim skillet. When it's almost done, add the onion to cook it also. Once the hamburger meat and onion mixtures is thoroughly cooked, empty the pan into a colander in the sink to drain the fat. Set aside once drained.</li></p>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>TIP:Be sure to run hot water if you plan on running the grease down your drain.</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p><li>Next mix the entire tub of ricotta cheese with one egg. You can also add some shredded cheese into the mixture if you desire.</li></p>
                
                <p><li>Pour a thin layer of sauce into the bottom of your 9 X 13 baking pan. Spread it out to where it covers the bottom evenly.
                </li></p>

                <p><li>Now for tha assembly. Begin with a single layer of lasagna noodles on top of the thin sauce layer. From there place a layer of the ricotta/egg mixture, hamburger meat on top of that, then shredded cheese. Add more pasta sauce and repeat until the pan is filled</li></p>

                <p><li>When you have filled the pan, put the remainder of the sauce and cheese on theh top.</li></p>

                <p><li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake for abour 1 hour at 350 degrees. In the final ten minutes you can remove the aluminum foil so the cheese on top browns. you will know that it's done when a knife can be pushed in smoothly. If it feels like the noodles are still too hard, add an extra 10 minutes until it is done. </li></p>
